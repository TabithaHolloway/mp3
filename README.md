Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 have been committed to the master branch one at a time. 

Due to VM problems, the team could not access questions 6 on the VM and so we could not run "mvn -Plight-test install" to check that all code compiles and all tests pass. We emailed Dr. Yu about our VM problems and asked for an extension. The following is her reply:

"Yes. Submit what you have now, and the rest of the work as soon as you have access to your VM."
